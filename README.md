# AB Testing Plugin
This plugin provides features to design AB testing and analyses their outcome. 

## Design
A web app computes the minimum sample sizes needed in the experiment while providing insightful visualisations of the distributions (Z test). A custom recipe can then use these estimated figures to split the input dataset containing the email addresses of the experiment population into two groups, A and B. 

## Analysis of the results
Once the experiment is complete, the user may upload the results back to DSS. With a custom recipe, she computes the resulting statistics (conversion rate per group). With the second web app, she can analyse these results and determine the outcome of the statistical test.
